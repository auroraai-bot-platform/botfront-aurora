# Documentation

The [official documentation](https://botfront.io/docs/getting-started/setup) of Botfront is hosted on [botfront.io](https://botfront.io/docs/getting-started/setup). It is automatically built and updated on every new release. Once you've installed the cli you can also use `botfront docs` to open it.

**We welcome contributions!** It can be as easy as clicking on the "Edit page on Github" link at the bottom of every documentation pages.

# Development

### Installation

**!!Development version of Botfront doesn't seem to run on Windows so continue the process below with Linux or Mac!!**

1. Botfront is a Meteor app, so the first step is to [install Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/install)
2. Then clone this repo and install the dependencies:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:auroraai-bot-platform/botfront-private.git
cd botfront/botfront
meteor npm install
```
3. Install the CLI from the source code:
```bash
# if you installed Botfront CLI from npm uninstall it.
npm uninstall -g botfront
# Install the cli from the source code
cd cli && npm link
```
Botfront needs to be connected to other services, especially Rasa. To do this, you need to create a regular project, and start Botfront with a dedicated configuration:

- Create a Botfront project with `botfront init` (somewhere else, not in the repo)
- Start your project with `botfront up -e botfront`. This will run all services except the Botfront app, since you are going to run it with Meteor locally
- Go back to the botfront checkout `cd botfront/botfront` and run Botfront with `meteor npm run start:docker-compose.dev`. Botfront will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) so open your browser and happy editing :smile_cat:
- Go to back to the botfront app directory. Open `./.botfront/botfront.yml` and add the correct projectId and change the bf_url. Otherwise the rasa instance cannot
connect to botfront.
```shell
bf_project_id: '<PROJECT-ID>'
bf_url: 'http://host.docker.internal:3000/graphql'
```
- If on Linux go open `docker-compose-template.yml` and add to the rasa service definition to give access to the host
```shell
extra_hosts:
      - "host.docker.internal:host-gateway"
```
    
### TroubleShooting

Some [botfront cli](https://github.com/botfront/botfront/blob/master/cli/src/cli.js) commands that may help if you run into problems:

```shell
botfront init     # create a new botfront project
botfront logs     # show the logs!
botfront killall  # stop all docker services
botfront down     # stop all botfront services
botfront up       # restart botfront
botfront docs     # open the docs in your browser
```

Note that these should be run from the same directory as your botfront project

### Contribute

We ‚ù§Ô∏è contributions of all size and sorts. If you find a typo, if you want to improve a section of the documentation or if you want to help with a bug or a feature, here are the steps:

1. Fork the repo and create a new branch, say `fix-botfront-typo-1`
2. Fix/improve the codebase
3. Commit the changes. **Commit message must follow [the naming convention](#commit-messages-naming-convention)**, say `fix(conversation builder): display story groups in alphabetical order`
4. Make a pull request. **Pull request name must follow [the naming convention](#commit-messages-naming-convention)**. It can simply be one of your commit messages, just copy paste it, e.g. `fix(readme): improve the readability and move sections`
5. Submit your pull request and wait for all checks passed (up to an hour)
6. Request reviews from one of the developers from our core team.
7. Get a üëç and PR gets merged.

Well done! Once a PR gets merged, here are the things happened next:
- all Docker images tagged with `branch-master` will be automatically updated in an hour. You may check the status on the [Actions](https://github.com/botfront/botfront/actions) tab.
- your contribution and commits will be included in [our release note](https://github.com/botfront/botfront/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

### Commit messages naming convention

To help everyone with understanding the commit history of Botfront, we employ [`commitlint`](https://commitlint.js.org/#/) to enforce the commit styles:

```text
type(scope?): subject
```

where `type` is one of the following:

- build
- ci
- chore
- docs
- feat
- fix
- perf
- refactor
- revert
- style
- test

`scope` is optional, represents the module your commit working on.

`subject` explains the commit.

As an example, a commit that improved the documentation:
```text
docs(conversation builder): update slots manager screenshot.
```

# Testing

## Unit & Integration Testing
Unit tests are running through the meteor mocha package `meteortesting:mocha`.
Tests should be stored in `*.test.js` files beside the source code js files.

### Installation
* run `npm ci` to install the dependencies

### Run all tests
This will take a while
* run `npm run test-once`

### Run only tests related to the REST API
This will run all tests, which contain `REST:` within the description
* run `npm run test-rest`

## E2E Testing
End to end tests are using the Cypress testing framework.
The first test case `01_initial_setup_dont_change_name/initial_setup.spec.js` drops the mongo database on startup and creates own test user.
The test user is necessary to run the e2e tests.

```shell
email: test@test.com
password: aaaaaaaa00
```

### Installation
* install `mongo` client as the first testcase will drop the whole database via the mongo client
* run `meteor npm install` inside `botfront/cypress` to install the cypress plugins



### Run all tests
* run `meteor npm run start:docker-compose.dev` to run botfront in dev mode
* run `meteor npx cypress run`

### Run single test file with existing database
* create the aforementioned test user inside the system
* run `npx cypress run --spec cypress/<path_to_spec.js>`

### Run single test file with a clean database
* run `npx cypress run --spec cypress/integration/01_initial_setup_dont_change_name/initial_setup.spec.js` to drop the database and create test user one time
* run `npx cypress run --spec cypress/<path_to_spec.js>`

### Run tests from the Cypress UI
* create the test user via hand or via the first test case
* run `npx cypress open

**Some tests also require Rasa to be available.**
